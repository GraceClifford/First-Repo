kaggle-submission.xml is the process of a simple decision tree built in RapidMiner 5.3. The model was trained on Kaggle's Titanic Survivorship dataset and achieved 70.9% predictive accuracy. After submitting my process, I found that the bootstrapping validation method gave the most accurate evaluative results on my test/train tree for predicting Kaggle's evaluation with the full dataset.
